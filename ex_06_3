# The following program counts the number of times the letter “a” appears in a string:

#word = 'banana'
#count = 0
#for letter in word:
 #   if letter == 'a':
  #      count = count + 1
#print(count)

#Exercise 3: Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.

def count(word,letter):
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter == 'a':
            count = count + 1
    print(count)

word = input("word:")
letter = input("letter:")


count(word, letter)
